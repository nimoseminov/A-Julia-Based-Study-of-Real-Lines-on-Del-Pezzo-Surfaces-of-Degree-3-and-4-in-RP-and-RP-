# A Julia Based Study of Real Lines on Del Pezzo Surfaces of Degree 3 and 4 in $$\mathbb{RP}^3$$ ³ and RP⁴

This project aims to study the number of real lines on real cubic and quartic Del Pezzo surfaces embedded in the real projective spaces RP³ and RP⁴. Building upon the results from Francesco Russo’s paper “The antibirational involutions of the plane and the classification of real del Pezzo surfaces” (in Algebraic Geometry, de Gruyter, 2002, pp. 289–312), we utilize the count of real lines to classify the corresponding topological types of Del Pezzo surfaces in RP³ and RP⁴.

Implemented in the Julia programming language, this project employs the defining polynomial equations of the surfaces to automatically identify and count all real lines contained therein, providing an effective computational tool for investigating the real structures of Del Pezzo surfaces in real algebraic geometry.
